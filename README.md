### Neon grid art

Below is an inline SVG that renders right on GitHub. It uses gradients, and soft blur, for a premium look. Save it as `art.svg` if you want it standalone.

### Play in the README

GitHub does not run scripts in README files. Here is a clever game that still works.

Open the spoiler below, and pick a path. No refresh needed. It feels like a tiny console.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Start game</strong></summary>

  **You are in a repo.** Two folders ahead.

  1. `src/`,  
  2. `docs/`.

  Choose `src/`, or `docs/`.

  <details>
    <summary>src/</summary>

    `src` has two files.

    1. `engine.ts`,  
    2. `treasure.json`.

    <details>
      <summary>engine.ts</summary>

      You ran tests. All green. The key appears: **K7**.

    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>treasure.json</summary>

      You found the lock. It asks for the key. Think **K7**. Door opens.  
      **Reward**: copy this badge into your profile.

      `![Winner](https://img.shields.io/badge/treasure-unlocked-03cb87)`

    </details>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>docs/</summary>

    The docs have a map.

    1. Road A,  
    2. Road B.

    <details>
      <summary>Road A</summary>

      Dead end. Back.

    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Road B</summary>

      Hidden note: **Look in src**.

    </details>
